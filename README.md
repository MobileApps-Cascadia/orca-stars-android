User Stories:

	1. Anise is a marine biologist. She loves marine life, and ever since
	 she was little, Orcinus orca has been her favorite. She’s always 
	 upset when she sees in the news that more animals have died from 
	 eating or choking on plastic. She wants to take a stand and stop 
	 supporting the companies that contribute to this, but she doesn’t 
	 know of any nearby places that focus on sustainability to protect 
	 animals like her beloved orcas. She wants an app that can tell her 
	 what businesses around her location are dedicated to preserving the 
	 environment.

	2. Logan is a highschool student whose highschool recently got 
	nominated by OrcaStars for their “Go Green” program. He wants to learn
	more about his local businesses, so that he can support the ones that 
	focus on sustainability. He doesn’t have the time to visit all of them 
	individually, either in person or on their website, to know if they 
	are part of OrcaStars. He wants to be able to easily search through 
	OrcaStars businesses, and learn what each one does for the environment 
	to preserve the orca population.
