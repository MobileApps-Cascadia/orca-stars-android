User Stories:

	1. Anise is a marine biologist. She loves marine life, and ever since she was little, Orcinus orca has been her favorite. She’s always upset when she sees in the news that more animals have died from eating or choking on plastic. She wants to take a stand and stop supporting the companies that contribute to this, but she doesn’t know of any nearby places that focus on sustainability to protect animals like her beloved orcas. She wants an app that can tell her what businesses around her location are dedicated to preserving the environment.

	2. Logan is a highschool student whose highschool recently got nominated by OrcaStars for their “Go Green” program. He wants to learn more about his local businesses, so that he can support the ones that focus on sustainability. He doesn’t have the time to visit all of them individually, either in person or on their website, to know if they are part of OrcaStars. He wants to be able to easily search through OrcaStars businesses, and learn what each one does for the environment to preserve the orca population.
